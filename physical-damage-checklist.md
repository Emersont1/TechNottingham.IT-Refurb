# Physical damage checklist
## Rationale
We need a simple and standardised way to check machines for damage. This document will act as a checklist that can be given to volunteers who will determine whether to reject or reset devices.

## Guidelines
1. When adding to this checklist, use **positively phrased questions**: for example, "Is the keyboard not flush to the chassis of the machine?" can be positively phrased as **"Does the keyboard bulge out from the chassis?"**. Avoiding negation makes it less likely that the question will be misread by someone who is tired or going through the document quickly.
2. Items should only be checked off **if there is a problem**. This allows someone viewing the final checklist to see quickly how many issues an individual machine has. For example, "Does the machine stay on when it is disconnected from mains power?" can be rephrased as **Does the machine turn off when it is disconnected from mains power?**

If you have something to add but are having trouble with the phrasing, make a pull request anyway and we can work it out there.

## Checklists
### Laptop
#### Battery
- [ ] Does the machine stay on when it is disconnected from mains power?
- [ ] Does the keyboard bulge out from the chassis?

#### Screen
- [ ] Are there cracks in the screen?
- [ ] Are there noticeably unusable areas of the screen?
- [ ] Are there any vertical lines running down the screen?
- [ ] Are there any dead pixels? (Individual pixels that are stuck as one color or do not turn on)
- [ ] Are there any pressure marks? (Lighter areas of the screen that appear to be smudges but do not come off when wiped)
