# TechNottingham.IT-Refurb

## What is this?
A GitHub repository where we are planning out and discussing the [Device Donate and Refurb Project run by Tech Nottingham](https://www.technottingham.com/news/2020/6/19/announcing-the-device-donate-amp-refurb-project)

This repository was started by members of the Tech Nottingham community and is not at this time an official Tech Nottingham repository.

## How does it work?
We are currently discussing a set of questions about how we are going to carry out this project as Issues on GitHub. The first post of each issue is a log of a previous Slack discussion (which we had in Slack threads before making the decision to move it onto GitHub.)

## Contributing
Currently we are in the stage of gathering as many ideas as possible, so the key thing is to get as many points of view as possible to make sure we actually have a decent overview of the situation and the caveats of different approaches. Don't tell people their ideas are flat out silly or unrealistic. We will go through them later, evaluate them and use them as a guide for creating a more final plan.

Or join us to discuss in **#it-refurb** on the Tech Nottingham Slack!
